*A retrospective from* <em><font style="color: #F86759">December 12th, 2024</font></em>
## Making Progress
10 amazing days of my [[100DaysOfCode]] commitment have passed, and so it's time for a reflection.

Each day was a challenge - too many new concepts, too little time, slow progress, feeling overwhelmed and frustrated...

But in retrospect, today I find myself a lot more capable vs 10 days ago!
- no longer afraid of the [[CLI]] (mostly thanks to [[Warp]])
- comfortable using [[Cursor]] as my [[IDE]]
- know enough [[Git]], [[HTML]], and [[CSS]] to deploy a simple web page
- can create custom themes for [[Roam]] and [[Obsidian]]

## Main Resource
[[The Odin Project]] curriculum strikes a good balance between "learning enough" and "moving forward".

Having covered the first 6 modules of the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) over the past 10 days:
1. my current level of [[CLI]], [[Git]], [[HTML]], and [[CSS]] feels basic, but sufficient to start exploring [[JavaScript]]
2. I am equipped with an excellent library of reference materials to revisit and deepen my understanding of these foundational topics as needed

## Supplementary Resources
[[Khan Academy]] has been a great complement on various topics. 
- The first two units of the [Computer Science Principles](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles) course provide a great intro to computers and the Web. 
- The second unit of the [Computer Programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) course is an easy-going way to review and practice the basics of [[HTML]] & [[CSS]]

## AI Tools
The [Complete Cursor](https://www.jointakeoff.com/courses/cursor) course from [[Takeoff]] has been instrumental in making [[Cursor]] an indispensable tool in my [[100DaysOfCode]] journey. Difficult to imagine learning to code without such an [[IDE]] enhancement.

[[Warp]] is another gem that transformed my fear of the command line into genuine appreciation. The team produced [a great playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTEsfOte9N3gmvIBBxJ0hPV9_yc7oVrSw) covering the [[CLI]] basics. 

[[Perplexity]] is my go-to research assistant.

[[ChatGPT]] is my thinking partner.

## Books

[[Code - The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software]] - to better understand computers.

[[Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous]] - to better understand the possibilities of the command line.

Wish I had more time for such wonderful books :)
