The curriculum allows to balance "learning enough" with "moving forward", while also providing an excellent reference library for future exploration.
### [[Khan Academy]]
The first two units of the [Computer Science Principles](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles) course provide a great intro to computers and the Web. 

The second unit of the [Computer Programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) course is an easy-going way to review and practice the basics of [[HTML]] & [[CSS]].
### [[Takeoff]]
The [Complete Cursor](https://www.jointakeoff.com/courses/cursor) demonstrates of all the key features of [[Cursor]], along with some tips on how to make the most out of the tool.
