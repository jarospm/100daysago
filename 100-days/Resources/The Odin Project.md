The Odin Project (TOP) is a free resource for learning the basics of programming. It stands out by teaching in a real-world environment from the start. 

Unlike traditional beginner tutorials that often isolate learners in controlled setups, TOP equips students with the essential real-world tools right away (like CLI, Git, and VS Code). 

The curriculum is designed to focus on the essentials, allowing learners to progress effectively. At the same time, it offers an abundance of high-quality references for those wishing to dive deeper.
