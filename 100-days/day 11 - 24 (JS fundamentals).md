[[100DaysOfCode]] reflection from <em><font style="color: #F86759">December 26th, 2024</font></em>
## Reflections
- Active learning with [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting) and [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) tutorials is a good way to escape the magic of [[Cursor]], which can make it tricky to balance "moving fast" with "feeling lost".
- Happy with the progress, but feeling a need to take a step back and re-visit the fundamentals.
## Learnings
### Concepts
- fundamentals of [[JavaScript]]
### Tools
- create and merge [[Git]] branches
- run [[JavaScript]] via [[Chrome DevTools]]
## Practice

## Resources
### [[The Odin Project]]
Completed the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) - great starting point.

Taking a step back to re-visit some of the covered topics with [ MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting) and [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) tutorials.
### [[LeetCode]]
Found the [30 Days of JavaScript](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/) series of challenges to be an effective way to practice and dive deeper into the newly learned concepts. 
## Books
Continue to slowly read [[Code - The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software]] during off-screen time.
