## Resources
### [[The Odin Project]]
Completed the first 6 modules of the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) - a solid introduction to [[CLI]], [[Git]], [[Chrome DevTools]], [[HTML]], and [[CSS]].

The curriculum allows to balance "learning enough" with "moving forward", while also providing an excellent reference library for future exploration.
### [[Khan Academy]]
The first two units of the [Computer Science Principles](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles) course provide a great intro to [[Programming#Computer Basics|computers]] and [[Programming#The Web Basics|the web]] 

The second unit of the [Computer Programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming) course is an easy-going way to review and practice the basics of [[HTML]] & [[CSS]].
### [[Takeoff]]
The [Complete Cursor](https://www.jointakeoff.com/courses/cursor) demonstrates the key features of [[Cursor]], along with some tips on how to make the most out of the tool.
## Books
Started to read:
- [[Code - The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software]] - to better understand how computers works.
- [[Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous]] - to better understand the possibilities of [[CLI]].
